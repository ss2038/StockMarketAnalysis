This project showcases how different modeling techniques can be leveraged to predict stock prices, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. 
ARIMA models handle trend and seasonality; KNN focuses on distances and local similarities; whereas LSTMs excel in learning from sequences with long-term dependencies. 
The project effectively demonstrates the application of these diverse methods in financial forecasting, providing valuable insights into their practical utilities and limitations. 
This comparative approach not only highlights the specific conditions under which each model performs best but also advances the understanding of predictive modeling in financial markets.

Challenges that occured in the Stock Market Dataset:
Missing Data: Handling days when the market is closed (weekends and holidays) or missing values for some stocks.
Outliers: Extreme price swings or volume spikes due to unforeseen events, which can skew analysis.
Noise: Stock market data is famously noisy and non-stationary, requiring sophisticated methods for analysis like those you are applying (ARIMA, KNN, LSTM).


Overview: 
Analyzed a comprehensive stock market dataset from Kaggle featuring over 5 million rows, encompassing daily trading data such as open, close, high, low prices, and volumes for multiple stocks, to develop predictive models using ARIMA, KNN, and LSTM techniques.
Achieved robust model performance, with predictive accuracy metrics including RMSE and MAPE, enhancing investment strategies for Tesla and Microsoft stocks.
